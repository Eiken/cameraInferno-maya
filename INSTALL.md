# Download

***Camera Inferno*** is available for all platforms and can be downloaded from
the [Releases](https://github.com/david-cattermole/cameraInferno-maya/releases)
page on the GitHub
[project page](https://github.com/david-cattermole/cameraInferno-maya).

Download the archive (`.zip`) file. This archive can be installed on all
operating systems (Linux, Windows, MacOS) and Maya versions (2017+),
although some systems have are not tested and may fail.

**Do not** install from the
`Source code (zip)` or `Source code (tar.gz)` archives. These archives
are for developers only.

# Install Maya Module

***Camera Inferno*** can be installed by un-zipping the archive
(`.zip`) file, and copying the contents into the
following directory on your computer:

On Windows:
```
C:\Users\<Your User Name>\My Documents\maya\<Maya Version>\modules
```

On Linux:
```
~/maya/<Maya Version>/modules
```

On MacOS:
```
~/Library/Preferences/Autodesk/maya/<Maya Version>/modules
```

Note: The MacOS Finder App hides the "Library" folder. To open the
Maya preferences folder, open Finder, and use the menu `Go > Go to
Folder...`, then type `~/Library/Preferences/Autodesk/maya` and press
"Go".

You may need to create the *modules* directory manually, as it is not
created default by Maya.

You should now have one file and one directory like this:
```
<maya user directory>\2017\modules\cameraInferno-0.1.0.mod (module file)
<maya user directory>\2017\modules\cameraInferno-0.1.0 (directory)
```

You can open Maya as normal and the tool will be recognised
automatically at start-up.
